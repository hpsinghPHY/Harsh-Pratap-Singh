        <h2>Research Experience</h2>
        <h3>M.Sc. Project: Wave-Particle Interaction for Acceleration</h3>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> In my master’s thesis, I investigated the acceleration of electrons in a laser wakefield, comparing the energy gain of electrons using LASER and microwave in a plasma-filled waveguide. This study aimed to understand the efficiency of Laser-Wakefield particle accelerators, which have applications in particle acceleration technology, synchrotron sources, radiotherapy, and semiconductor doping. Additionally, I explored the Drift Tube Linac (cavity resonator) at Inter-University Accelerator Center.</p>
