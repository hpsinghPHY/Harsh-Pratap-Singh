## Work Experience
### Graduate Teaching Assistant, IIT Delhi [2022-2023]
**Role:** Teaching Assistantship (TA) for PYL101 EM Waves and Quantum Mechanics at the Department of Physics, IIT Delhi.
**Responsibilities:** Conducting tutorials for UG B. Tech. first-year students and exam evaluation.

## Research Experience
### M.Sc. Project: Wave-Particle Interaction for Acceleration
**Description:** In my master’s thesis, I investigated the acceleration of electrons in a laser wakefield, comparing the energy gain of electrons using LASER and microwave in a plasma-filled waveguide. This study aimed to understand the efficiency of Laser-Wakefield particle accelerators, which have applications in particle acceleration technology, synchrotron sources, radiotherapy, and semiconductor doping. Additionally, I explored the Drift Tube Linac (cavity resonator) at Inter-University Accelerator Center.
